# Data_Visualization_Project3
Overview
Social media serves as a widespread communication channel. Beyond personal connections, imagine harnessing it for social change. Consider the collective criticism of pothole-ridden highways or the praise for a new downtown coffee shop. These reactions provide valuable insights for improving our community and enhancing quality of life by providing business opportunities or governmental enhancements.

Ethical Considerations
Our team always had privacy in mind while working on this project. Therefore when cleaning our data we removed users ID names and only focused on the main questions. We checked our data and graphs to keep everything professional without exploiting others. As well as making sure that credit was given to those that helped us create our data. When handling the data we followed relevent laws in order to protect any personal information.
